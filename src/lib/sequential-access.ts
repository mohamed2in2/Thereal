/**
 * Sequential lesson gating.
 *
 * Course.sequentialAccess has existed in the schema and in the teacher panel
 * ("إجباري بالترتيب") since early on, but nothing on the server ever read it —
 * a teacher could switch it on and students still jumped straight to any
 * lesson. This module makes the control real.
 *
 * Because the flag has been a no-op while defaulting to true in the panel, most
 * existing courses almost certainly have it set. Turning enforcement on
 * globally would lock students out of lessons they legitimately reached before.
 * So enforcement is additionally gated on the platform config
 * `sequential_access_enforced`, which defaults to false: flip it once you have
 * checked how many courses carry the flag.
